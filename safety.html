                            disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre
                            apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub
                            frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance. Most people infected with the
                            virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
                            However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying
                            medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more
                            likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any
                            age.

                        <ul>
                            <li class="lead my-3">School administrators should provide opportunities for the faculty to practice drills,
                                ask questions, and make suggestions based on their experiences. The faculty must be equipped
                                with the skills and knowledge to confidently lead during an emergency while still maintaining
                                the freedom to make decisions that best suit each situation.</li><br>
                            <li class="lead my-3">The best school safety precaution is to end a threat before it can begin. Threats can be lessened
                                and even eliminated at the door with an ID entrance policy. A policy such as this requires that only
                                those who have a school ID will be allowed inside the facility.  This process secures the main entrance
                                and creates a strategic step toward school safety.</li><br>
                            <li class="lead my-3">Keeping the students engaged with the faculty and their studies is a key component of school safety.
                                All students are helpers when it comes to school safety. They may see and know things that faculty members
                                are not privy to and can alert the proper staff members to the possibility of a threat. A student is more
                                likely to help in this area if they feel the faculty is approachable and has a positive and helpful
                                attitude toward all the students.</li><br>
                            <li class="lead my-3">An obvious mechanism for safety and security are locks on doors and windows. Since these can keep out
                                threats and secure a room of students and faculty, it is important that locks should be easy to reach and
                                use.</li><br>
                            <li class="lead my-3">School faculty should be shown how important the security of their school is, as well as, how important
                                they are to gaining and keeping that security. Impress on them the importance of drilling and knowing how
                                to secure the students if there is an incident.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li class="lead my-3">It is true that there is safety in numbers, so each student should make that a motto. Not only are you
                                        less likely to be a target when traveling in a group, there will be others to help you during an adverse
                                        situation.</li><br>
                                    <li class="lead my-3">A true sense of safety comes when you know where you are at all times. All students should be encouraged
                                        to walk around the school facility and learn the halls, the exits, and each room location for ease
                                        of access.</li><br>
                                    <li class="lead my-3">It is important to be watchful and to note anything out of the ordinary. A student who is encouraged to
                                        know the school facility along with its safety precautions will be more cognizant of things that should be
                                        reported. This knowledge of surroundings could eliminate a threat.</li><br>
                                    <li class="lead my-3">Students should be encouraged and invited to report any activity they think is suspicious.
                                        A school should create a procedure for taking reports on suspicious activities and how they deal
                                        with them.</li><br>
                                    <li class="lead my-3">It can be a difficult task, but it is absolutely necessary that no negative behavior be allowed toward any student. Students should be encouraged to refrain from bullying of any kind and all classes, talks, or education resources should be implemented to help eliminate bullying in schools.</li>

                    <p class="lead my-3">Measures for protecting workers from exposure to and infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus
                        that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), depends on exposure risk. That risk varies based on the
                        type of work being performed, the potential for interaction (prolonged or otherwise) with people, and
                        contamination of the work environment. Employers should adopt infection prevention and control strategies
                        based on a thorough workplace hazard assessment, using appropriate combinations of engineering and
                        administrative controls, safe work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent worker
                        exposures. Some OSHA standards that apply to preventing occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 also require
                        employers to train workers on elements of infection prevention and control, including PPE.</p>
                    <p class="lead my-3">The general guidance below is meant to inform all U.S. workers and employers, but does
                        not alter compliance responsibilities for any particular industry. Depending on where their operations
                        fall in OSHA's exposure risk pyramid, workers and employers should also consult additional, specific
                        guidance for those at either lower (i.e., caution) or increased (i.e., medium, high, or very high) risk
                        of exposure. The exposure risk pyramid and a workplace hazard assessment, can help workers and employers
                        identify exposure risk levels commonly associated with various sectors.</p>
                    <p class="lead my-3">All employers should remain alert to and informed about changing outbreak conditions,
                        including as they relate to community spread of the virus and testing availability, and implement infection
                        prevention and control measures accordingly.</p>
