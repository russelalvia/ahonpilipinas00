            <p class="lead my-3"><b>MANILA, 22 August</b> - Millions of students returned to classrooms across the Philippines today, for the first time in more than two years.
                The Philippines was one of the last few countries to transition back to face-to-face learning after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted
                education across the world.<br>
                Around 24,000 of the country's public schools - or just less than half - will resume five days of face-to-face classes this
                week. The rest will hold a mix of in-person and online classes until November 2nd, when all 27 million registered students are
                expected to head back to the classroom full-time.

            <hr>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                Both public and private higher education institutions (HEIs) have had to adjust to the new situation,
                which prohibits face-to-face interaction and large-scale gatherings. The top universities and colleges in the Philippines,
                especially those that are part of the ASEAN University Network, such as the University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila
                University, and De la Salle University, came up with novel ways to carry out their three responsibilities of education,
                research, and community service. They were dedicated to carrying out their mandate. Work-from-home arrangements were accepted
                by all, including administrators and teachers as well as the operations and support service units.<br>
                As they switched to alternative or remote teaching modalities, both synchronous and asynchronous, teachers and administrators
                were tasked with revising and adapting course syllabi and requirements from the comfort of their homes. Learning management
                systems like Canvas, Moodle, and Blackboard, in addition to applications like Google Hangouts, Zoom, and Skype, were utilized
                wherever educators and students had access to electronic devices and dependable Internet connections. Be that as it may, where
                understudies had restricted admittance to PCs or untrustworthy admittance to the Web, instructors, and understudies utilized
                cell phones to trade messages, notes, and materials, through message informing, email, Facebook Courier, and Twitter.<br>
                Because of the varying socioeconomic status of students, these arrangements sometimes became unsustainable, necessitating the
                suspension of remote or online classes at some universities. Likewise, concerns concerning the emotional wellness of the two
                understudies and educators impacted by the vulnerability, turned into one more motivation to suspend online classes.

            <hr>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                In all areas, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about an unprecedented crisis. This emergency has
                resulted in the widespread closure of face-to-face activities at educational institutions in over 190 countries in order to
                mitigate the virus's impact and prevent its spread.<br>
                The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has argued that the social situation in the region was
                getting worse before the pandemic hit because of the persistence of inequality, rising rates of extreme poverty, and growing
                social discontent. The crisis will have a profoundly negative effect on employment, poverty, and the various social sectors,
                particularly education and health care. As a result of the crisis, the suspension of face-to-face classes at all levels has
                resulted in three main areas of action, according to UNESCO, which has identified major gaps in educational outcomes related
                to the unequal distribution of teachers in general and of the best-qualified teachers in particular. This is to the detriment
                of lower-income countries and regions as well as rural areas. the use of distance learning methods in a variety of formats and
                platforms (whether or not technology is used); the assistance of educators and communities, as well as their mobilization;
                what's more, regions, where native and transient populaces will generally be concentrated.<br>
                Many of the measures that the countries in the region have taken to improve education focus on students' health and overall
                well-being. The point of this report is to reveal insight into different results that these actions will have on instructive
                networks in the short and medium term, and to propose key suggestions on the most proficient method to deal with those outcomes
                in the most ideal way, causing to notice potential open doors for learning and advancement in the post-pandemic schooling
                system.
