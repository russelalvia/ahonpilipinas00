            <p class="lead my-3">
                When the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect people around the world in mid-2020, the World Bank launched COVID-19 surveys to
                track the pandemic's social and economic impacts on communities.  The community survey conducted in collaboration with the
                Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in the Philippines provided important insights into how to best deliver
                pandemic response and recovery programs aimed at supporting the poorest and most vulnerable rural communities. Respondents
                included community volunteers and barangay (village) officials from some of the country's poorest communities, as identified
                by the country's current national community-driven development project. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                The first round of the community survey had 180 respondents representing 101 barangays in August 2020. The second round,
                which will take place in April 2021, will include 200 respondents from 135 barangays spread across the three main groups of
                islands: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.<br>
                Respondents were asked to share their perspectives on the situation in their communities using a standard questionnaire
                designed to capture the community's socioeconomic conditions. These findings reflect community leaders' general observations
                based on their perceptions and knowledge of their respective communities.

            <h2 class="fst-talic"><i>Economic impacts on communities</i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                COVID-19 has had a significant impact on rural livelihoods. Loss of income and job opportunities were major issues in the
                Philippines' poor communities.<br>
                Disaster-prone communities struggled more with COVID-19 restrictions and their severe economic impact. According to the
                findings, the most pressing issues prior to and during COVID-19 were: 
            </p>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                • Lack of income opportunities and pay cuts were already issues, but the pandemic had exacerbated them significantly.<br>
                • Communities reported that there was still insufficient food supply and health, sanitation, and nutrition issues during the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                Because the communities that were surveyed are already a subset of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in the
                Philippines, the economic impact of COVID-19 is especially concerning. Following critical work and pay misfortunes,
                networks are in danger of additional expansions in destitution.<br>
                In August 2020, employment misfortunes were especially serious in the development area (56%) and public transportation
                (52%) while aggregate employment misfortunes were seen among casual laborers like clothing ladies, beauticians, and laborers
                in little flasks; and in informal retail settings like markets, street vendors, and "sari-sari" stores. According to reports,
                70% of communities in formal agriculture and 61% in small-scale farming saw significant job losses in the farming sector.
            </p>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                By the second round of the survey, which took place in April 2021, the situation had somewhat improved. The area that saw the
                greatest upgrades was retail, where the revealed rate of employment misfortunes diminished by 13%. However, job cuts continued
                to have the greatest impact on public transportation drivers and construction workers (56 percent and 52 percent, respectively).
            </p>
            <h2 class="fst-italic"><i>Social cohesion</i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                Due to COVID-19, seventy-four percent (74%) of communities did not experience any issues with community conflict, theft,
                crime, or arguments. Be that as it may, there was an expansion in harmony and request issues when the second round of the
                overview was done. It seemed like job loss was primarily to blame for this. Respondents reported that there was no increase
                in sexual harassment, rape, or domestic violence, despite an increase in cases of COVID-related discrimination. Be that as
                it may, discoveries from a free clash observing framework (Struggle Alert) covering a more modest region of the Philippines,
                the Bangsamoro Independent Locale in Muslim Mindanao recommends there might be more weak networks. The Contention Ready
                information, in view of police and media reports, uncovers a critical expansion in orientation-based savagery during the times
                of severe Coronavirus lockdown.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fst-italic"><i>Gender and Women's roles</i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                Women and men were found to be equally affected by job and income loss by half of the respondents, while women were found to
                be more affected by it by 29%. Due to COVID-19, women were also identified as one of the most in need of assistance.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fst-italic"><i>Health and Vaccine concerns</i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="lead my-3">
                In the Philippines, admittance to medical care during the pandemic stayed reliable, however, a fundamental test was the absence
                of clinical supplies and PPEs, particularly in the beginning stage. According to the survey, a lot of people were worried about
                the safety and effectiveness of vaccines (86 percent). The country's vaccination program was being slowed down as a result of
                vaccine reluctance. Most communities rely on medical professionals and doctors for vaccine information. However the respondents
                realized immunizations could forestall Coronavirus, they knew that well-being and chance moderation conventions were as yet
                required. While respondents by and large found the officially sanctioned rules and limitations proper, they proposed that
                neighborhood legislatures ought to be more severe and reliable in the requirement of these wellbeing related conventions.
                The Philippines' vaccine reluctance is still a problem, and more research is being done to find important incentives and
                positive messages.<br>
                The consequences of the local area study, alongside the firm and family overviews, were imparted to the Philippine government
                and different partners. The validity of the results will be increased in subsequent rounds, which will also provide an
                opportunity to concentrate on additional sub-themes, such as gender and coping strategies, or on any new themes that emerge as
                being relevant.<br>
                The survey demonstrates how COVID-19's economic effects affect rural poor and vulnerable communities. Proceeding, we trust
                that the significant experiences in the circumstance and view of the networks can assist with illuminating objective
                arrangements as well as reaction and recuperation programs.
