    <p class="lead my-3">By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses that cause colds, flu and COVID-19.</p>
    <p class="lead my-3">To ensure good hygiene you should:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li class="lead my-3">Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with either an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. This eliminates germs that may be on your hands, including viruses.</li>
        <li class="lead my-3">Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands.</li>
        <li class="lead my-3">Cleaning and disinfection: Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces in your home and workplace regularly. Use products that are effective against the COVID-19 virus.</li>
        <li class="lead my-3">Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently, especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.</li>
        <li class="lead my-3">Avoid touching your face: Refrain from touching your eyes, nose, and mouth as much as possible, as these areas can serve as entry points for the virus.</li>
        <li class="lead my-3">Stay home when sick: If you have symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, stay home, and seek medical advice. Follow the guidance of local health authorities regarding testing and self-isolation.</li>
    </ul>
